# Investigating_the_Effect_of_a_Windfarm_on_Bird_Distribution

In this project we examined impact assessment data from an offshore wind farm, the Horns Rev I windfarm located off the west coast of Denmark, which was built in 2002 and was the first large-scale offshore wind farm in the world. The data used here relates to the abundance and distribution of a large sea duck, common scoter (*Melanitta nigra*), and we sought to investigate whether they were affect by the wind farm's construction. We fitted a number of different models, including GLMs, GAMs and penalised/regularised regression models to the dataset in order to be able to answer the following research questions:

* Are there any differences in average abundance before and after impact?
* Of the covariates available, what are the best predictors of abundance?
* Is there any evidence of redistribution before and after impact?.
